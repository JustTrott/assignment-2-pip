I want you to set up this project structure and also log every prompt that I sent you to the AI usage MD. And also create a cursor rule for that
For now, do not fill the text in the markdown files, and you do not need to write any code, just create the files.
Well, except for AI usage. And can you also write in the AI usage that I'm using an application called Super Whisper to transcribe whatever I'm saying. Also, there are two people working on this project. I am Temirlan, and there will be another person Veyd. This doesn't relate to him, he may use other technologies.
```

**AI Response**: Set up complete project structure with all required directories and files, created AI_USAGE.md with initial documentation including team information and Super Whisper usage.
